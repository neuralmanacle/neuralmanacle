# Summary

This is a clone of the popular game tic-tac-toe using the react.js from the <a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">docs</a>.
It was a challenging yet fun ride through the docs and getting exposed to different beginner level concepts in react like hooks, props and states. React is a technology that requires 
a basic yet fundamental understanding of JavaScript. It is an amalgamation of the pillars of web-dev being Js,HTML and CSS. There is more to explore in the docs.
