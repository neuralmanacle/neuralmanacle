# Summary


A few months back I had picked up React.js without much knowledge of Javascript. To completely fill the knowledge gaps and to
work on the fundamentals, I decided to follow the [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) for FullStackDev using Javascript.

Although the Javascript didn't fully function, I was able to learn concepts like
- onClick() and forEach() methods under JavaScript
- CSS styling concepts
- HTML class manipulation using Javascript functions
